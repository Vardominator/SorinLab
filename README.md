# SorinLab - Molecular & Life Sciences Center
> California State University, Long Beach

## Description
The goal of this project is to develop a clustering suite for analyzing molecular dynamics (MD) simulation data produced by Folding@Home. 

From a scientific perspective, the Sorin Lab is aiming to find or develop clustering/clustering evalutation software that produces repeatable results on large ( 1 million+ points), relatively high-dimensional (8+ features) and complex MD datasets. This will lead to a better understanding of protein/RNA folding trajectories and conformational states. 

From a software perspective, the clustering suite will eventually grow to become an open-source clustering tool for researchers in the field of MD.
